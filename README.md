# 🧬 Z Genome Lab Lite — Symbolic Genomic Demonstrator

This is the **open-source showcase** of the Z Genome Lab platform — a revolutionary genomic engine powered by symbolic AI and dimensional logic.

> 🎯 **Purpose**: Demonstrate symbolic genome transformation in a simple, accessible way using symbolic intelligence.

## 🔍 What is Z Genome Lab Lite?

Z Genome Lab Lite is a **non-commercial**, simplified version of the full Z Genome Lab SaaS system.  
It enables users to:
- Upload example DNA sequences (.CSV)
- Apply symbolic genomic transformations using Z Logic
- Visualize symbolic mutations
- Explore transition-based symbolic mutations (SSM)
- Understand biologically-sound symbolic editing

> 🧪 Ideal for researchers, students, innovators, and early adopters.

## 🧬 Symbolic Stable Mutation (SSM)

Z Genome Lab introduces a novel symbolic concept in genomics:  
**SSM — Symbolic Stable Mutation**

This transformation applies transition-based symbolic mutation rules:

- **Adenine (A)** → **Guanine (G)**  
- **Thymine (T)** → **Cytosine (C)**  

These purine-to-purine and pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine substitutions ensure:

✅ Structural stability of the DNA double helix  
✅ Preservation of hydrogen bonding and molecular weight  
✅ Symbolic, explainable, and mathematically controlled mutation  

This is not random mutagenesis — it's a **stable, interpretable transformation** powered by symbolic logic.  
Implemented directly in the Z Genome Lab Lite engine.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Open the link above ☝️  
2. Upload a sample `.csv` file (or input a DNA sequence manually)  
3. Apply the symbolic Z mutation  
4. View predicted transitions and visualize changes  
5. Optionally, download results or mutation reports
