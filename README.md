# 🧬 Z Genome Lab Lite — Symbolic Genomic Demonstrator

This is the **open-source showcase** of the Z Genome Lab platform — a revolutionary genomic engine powered by symbolic AI and dimensional logic.

> 🎯 **Purpose**: Demonstrate symbolic genome transformation in a simple, accessible way using symbolic intelligence.

---

## 🔍 What is Z Genome Lab Lite?

Z Genome Lab Lite is a **non-commercial**, simplified version of the full Z Genome Lab SaaS system.  
It enables users to:
- Upload example DNA sequences (.CSV)
- Apply symbolic genomic transformations using Z Logic
- Visualize symbolic mutations
- Explore transition-based symbolic mutations (SSM)
- Understand biologically-sound symbolic editing

> 🧪 Ideal for researchers, students, innovators, and early adopters.

## 🧬 SSM™ + GenCom™ — A Symbolic Genetic Mutation & Command System

**Z Genome Lab™** introduces a groundbreaking innovation in symbolic synthetic biology:  
**SSM™ (Symbolic Stable Mutation)** + **GenCom™ (Genetic Command System)** — a programmable symbolic framework for genomic transformation and control.

---

### 🔬 Symbolic Mutation Rules (SSM™)
Applies deterministic symbolic substitutions to ensure mutation stability:

- **Adenine (A)** → **Guanine (G)**  
- **Thymine (T)** → **Cytosine (C)**

These transitions preserve:  
✅ DNA double-helix integrity  
✅ Hydrogen bonding logic  
✅ Symbolic, interpretable mutation dynamics

---

### 🧠 GenCom™ Integration  
GenCom™ enables symbolic-level control over gene expression, using programmable mutation logic and command operators to alter gene functions dynamically.
